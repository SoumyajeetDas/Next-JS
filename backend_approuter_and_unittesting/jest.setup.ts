// Good to know:extend-expect was removed in v6.0, so if you are using @testing-library/jest-dom before version 6, you will need to import
// @testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect instead.

import '@testing-library/jest-dom';

// If you are using fetch Api in your code, you need to import it in your test file.
